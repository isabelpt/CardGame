# War Card Game
I made this project for CS2 at Menlo School, 2022-2023<br/><br/>
Instructions:
<ul>
  <li>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.</li>
  <li>If the cards are the same rank, it is War.</li>
  <li>Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up.</li>
  <li>The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards).</li>
  <li>If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up.</li>
  <li>The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.</li>
  <li>The game ends when one player has won all the cards.</li>
 </ul>
